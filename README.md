#Vernisi: Weekly Design Challenges

####Welcome!

Over the course of 1 year, you'll design 52 different elements for mobile, web, and print. This project was built to provide a fun way to improve your skills as a designer and get feedback from others who are in the same boat. 

How this will work
1. Every week (on Monday) we'll send you an element to design. You have an entire week to design the prompt with hopefully some time left over before the next challenge!

2. Some prompts are intentionally high-level, so it's up to you to interpret how to design it (i.e. mobile vs web, full page vs one component, etc.)

3. Post your work to Dribbble (if you're a member) or Twitter/Facebook/Instagram with #vernisi and your prompt number (ex. "Just finished my first design for #vernisi #01")

4. Provide feedback to others who are doing the challenge

5. Become a better designer over the course of the year! 

*If weekly prompts are too slow for you, you can also choose to receive challenges every day, every other day, or bi-weekly (every 4 days)— shoot us an email at hi@vernisi.co*
